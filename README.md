Checklists/cheatsheets for preparing 2b-RAD libraries (Wang et al. 2012, Nature Methods 9(8):808-810)

These sheets can be printed, modified, etc., to simplify record-keeping when preparing 2b-RAD libraries.  The first sheet, for 56 samples, corresponds to the fact that our lab currently has 60 unique barcodes, and processing 56 samples corresponds to seven complete columns in a 96-well plate.
